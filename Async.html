<!-- Callback, Promises, and Async-await are a way to deal with asynchronous data. Asynchronous programming in JavaScript
is a way in which the program doesn’t wait until the execution of something is going on. -->

<!-- This comes in handy when we do an API call to fetch some data, which takes some time (maybe 2–3 sec). But we don’t want 
our program to stop executing the next statements and this is known as Async JS. -->

<!-- A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is called (or executed) inside 
    the otherFunction. -->

        //Callback
        // To use callback, we pass a new parameter callback in the createPost(). Then after the posts.push(post), we are 
        // calling the callback(). Now in the createPost() calling, we are passing a second parameter which is the function 
        // getPost. Now, only after the posts.push() will be run then the getPosts will be run and we will get all three 
        // posts.

        //Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, and its 
        //resulting value. It allows you to handle asynchronous operations more easily and with less code than using 
        //callbacks
        //A promise has three states:

        //pending: the promise is still in the works
        //fulfilled: the promise resolves successfully and returns a value
        //rejected: the promise fails with an error


        //When a promise is fulfilled, you can access the resolved data in the then method of the promise:
        //When a promise is rejected (that is, the promise fails), you can access the error information returned in the 
        //catch method of the promise:

        //Promises are a better version of callback and were introduced in ES6. Here, we don’t pass any argument but wrap the 
        //whole code in a Promise method and return it. We are passing two parameters, resolve and reject to it.

        //Now, whenever the resolve is run, the then() block from the function call is executed.we give error as false if no 
        //error then execute resolve function if nor then reject method


        function createdata2(newdata, callback) {
            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                setTimeout(() => {
                    data.push(newdata);
                    let error = false;
                    if (!error) {
                        resolve()
                    } else {
                        reject("Error")
                    }

                }, 2000);
            });
        }
        createdata2({
            name: "parth23rrr",
            prof: "frevr"
        }).then(getdata).catch(err => console.log("Error"));

        // Now, we will learn about async-await which is an upgrade over promises. It is called synthetic sugar over promises, 
        // because under the hood it is promises.

        // We are again using the old Promises example. Here, we are creating a new function init(), but with the keyword async. 
        // Inside the function, we are making createPost() as await. It means that the functions after it will await for it result. 
        // So, again we are getting everything in order.


        // async: async is a keyword used to declare a function as asynchronous. An asynchronous function returns a 
        // Promise, which can be resolved with a value or rejected with an error. By using the async keyword, the function 
        // can use the await keyword
        // // to pause the execution of the code until a Promise is resolved. When await is used, the JavaScript engine 
        //waits for the Promise to resolve before continuing with the execution of the code. The await keyword can only be
        // used inside an asynchronous function, and it can only be used with a Promise. When a Promise is resolved with 
        //a value, the value is returned by the await expression. If the Promise is rejected with an error, the error is 
        //thrown and can be caught using a try...catch statement or by using .catch() on the Promise.

        async function start() {
            await createdata2({
                name: "parth23rrr",
                prof: "frevr"
            });
            getdata();

<!-- Both callbacks and promises help make our code asynchronous. Making callbacks async can cause issues such as callback hell, so to avoid this we can use promises instead, doing this helps us avoid this pitfall while keeping our code async and neat. -->
<!-- async await makes more readable than promise  -->

<!-- call back hell -->
<!-- Nesting of callbacks can lead to an unreadable and not easy to manageable codebase commonly known as callback hell 
    in Node. js or pyramid of doom. Node js callback hell can be avoided using Promises and async / await. Splitting of 
    the functions and by writing comments can also be used to avoid callback hell in Node js. -->
